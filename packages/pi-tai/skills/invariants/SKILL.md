name: invariants
description: Design or review domain models, APIs, state machines, wire contracts, and persistence schemas so invalid states are difficult or impossible to represent. Use when creating or changing lifecycle, status, error, request/result, Rust enum, TypeScript discriminated-union, or boolean/optional-field models.

# Invariants

Goal: make invalid states unrepresentable without overengineering.

- Identify invariants, states, transitions, and trust boundaries before types.
- Struct/object: values coexist. Enum/discriminated union: states exclude each other.
- Keep one representation per fact. Derive booleans/status from authoritative data.
- Use `Option` only for independently optional data. Use variants when fields depend on state.
- Keep failure outside valid state with `Result<T, E>`. Model retry/close/failure disposition as variants, not conflicting flags.
- Use semantic newtypes, private fields, and smart constructors for validated IDs, times, hashes, URLs, and bounds.
- Parse untrusted input once at the boundary. Internal code receives validated domain types.
- Separate wire/persistence DTOs from strict domain types when storage or compatibility requires looser shapes. Convert explicitly.
- Encode transitions in methods or reducers. Prevent arbitrary lifecycle mutation.
- Preserve Rust tagged enums as TypeScript discriminated unions. Do not flatten them into optional-field bags.
- Prefer exhaustive security/domain states. Version external contracts; reject unknown security state.
- Use typestate for local compile-time sequences; tagged enums across async, persistence, and language boundaries.
- Prefer zero-cost newtypes/enums. Accept bounded boundary conversion or async dispatch cost when it improves correctness and auditability.
- Before finishing, list still-representable invalid combinations and refine the model or document the runtime enforcement point.
